\section{Introduction}

Introduce the problem you are addressing here, and give a very brief
overview of what you are about to report on.

\section{Implementation}

Explain briefly what you have implemented and how. This might also be
an appropriate place to explain how you verified the correctness of
your implementation.

\section{Experiments}

Explain what kind of experiments you run. Also tell what kind of
hardware and software were used to run the experiments.

Present your results numerically in a table, and also visually as a
plot. Remember to refer to the tables and figures in your text; it is
not sufficient to only include them, but they should also be made part
of the prose. Like so: here we refer to Table~\ref{tbl:resultscubic}.

\begin{table}[h]
  \begin{center}
  \caption{Write a caption that tells what this table is about.}
  \label{tbl:resultscubic}
  % Uncomment the line below to include the automatically generated
  % table from the file.
  % \input{threesum_cubic_tabular.tex}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

\begin{figure}[h]
  \begin{center}
    % uncomment the line below to include the plot that you
    % automatically generated.
    % \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{plot_cubic_vs_hashmap.pdf}
    \caption{Write a descriptive caption here.}
    \label{fig:runtimes}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
